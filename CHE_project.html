		<h1>What is Drought?</h1>
		<p>A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. It can have severe impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.
			Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It is a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage. Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.

An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most serious hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the world. Drought threatens people’s livelihoods, increases the risk of disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030.

Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions drier and wet regions wetter. In dry regions, this means that when temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the risk of drought or prolongs periods of drought. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe storms.

		<h1 id="causes">Causes of Drought</h1>
		<p>Droughts can be triggered by natural causes such as weather patterns. But increasingly they are caused by human activity.

			<h4><br>Manmade causes include:</h4>
			
			<h4><br>Climate change –</h4> Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world. Regions such as the U.S. Southwest, where droughts are expected to get more frequent, intense, and longer lasting, are at particular risk.

			How climate change contributes to drought:<br>
			
			<br>&#x2022;Warmer temperatures enhance evaporation, which reduces surface water and dries out soils and vegetation. This makes periods with low precipitation drier than they would be in cooler conditions.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Climate change is also altering the timing of water availability.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Warmer winter temperatures are causing less precipitation to fall as snow in the Northern Hemisphere, including in key regions like the Sierra Nevada of California.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Decreased snowpack can be a problem, even if the total annual precipitation remains the same. This is because many water management systems rely on spring snowpack melt . Likewise, certain ecosystems also depend on snowmelt, which supplies cold water for species like salmon. Because snow acts as a reflective surface, decreasing snow area also increases surface temperatures, further exacerbating drought.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Some climate models find that warming increases precipitation variability, meaning there will be more periods of both extreme precipitation and drought. This creates the need for expanded water storage during drought years and increased risk of flooding and dam failure during periods of extreme precipitation.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Climate change is making certain regions drier<br>
			<br>&#x2022;For example, the Southwestern United States has already seen a decrease in annual precipitation since the beginning of the 20th century, and that trend is expected to continue.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Estimates of future changes in seasonal or annual precipitation in a particular location are less certain than estimates of future warming, and are active areas of research. However, at the global scale, scientists are confident that relatively wet places, such as the tropics and higher latitudes, will get wetter, while relatively dry places in the subtropics (where most of the world’s deserts are located) will become drier.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;In some areas, droughts can persist through a vicious cycle, in which very dry soils and diminished plant cover absorb more solar radiation and heat up, encouraging the formation of high pressure systems that further suppress rainfall, leading an already dry area to become even drier.<br>
			<h4><br>Deforestation – </h4>
			<br>Is deforestation to blame for the areas around the world experiencing large-scale droughts? Scientists are starting to believe so. The negative effects of deforestation are well known: biodiversity is significantly impacted and a large amount of carbon is released into the atmosphere when trees are removed from their habitats. But what’s lesser known is its impact on the worsening droughts. Furthermore, some scientists postulate that we have cut so many forests that we might have reached a situation where severe drought is not only widespread but inevitable. What is the connection?<br>
		   
			<br>Unsurprisingly, the connections between forests and the climate are extremely complicated. Nevertheless, one simple fact is key: clouds require moisture. Forests, especially large expanses of rain forests, store moisture that, when it evaporates, aids in cloud formation. In forests, moisture collects on leaves, branches, and trunks. Forest soil retains moisture by its root systems, surface leaf litter, and prevents it from rapidly evaporating by the shade of the canopy (also, the temperatures are very low). Comparing habitats, a treeless savannah is hotter, and the soil stores far less water. Models showed a 30% reduction in evaporation from a savannah compared to a forest, with a corresponding reduction in rainfall.<br>
			<br><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
				<img src="https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2019-09-04/0.60868900_1567593966_45.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin: 0 10px;">
				<img src="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Deforestation_in_Tesso_Nilo_Sumatra/story_full_width/1e7g2a63k2_deforestation_causes_HI_104236.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin: 0 10px;">
			  </div><br>
			  
			<br>The reduced water storage seems to manifest itself in longer dry spells, e.g. drought. The full-on wet season still occurs (climate, particularly monsoon climate, has a global component), but the evaporation from the forest feeds the smaller rains in between rainy seasons. Those other rains provide a substantial amount of rainfall, and prevent complete aridity in between monsoons.<br>
		   
			<br>So forests are not the only contributor to rain, but they can influence the amount and timing of downpours. Now enters climate change, which if the worst predictions come true may be sending the Amazon towards a tipping point where the rainforest, and its contributions to rain, will be replaced by hotter, drier savannah. All of the factors threatening the forest can feed on themselves—as the forest is cleared, the rain decreases at a faster rate, leading to longer droughts and higher temperatures. The longer droughts lead to longer and hotter fires, which clear more forest, thus speeding up the process. At the same time, clearing the forest increases the contribution of CO2 into the atmosphere, speeding up climate change and the deforestation-drought-fire feedback loop.<br>
		   
			<br>How will all this affect the world? Nobody can say for sure—yet. Droughts are already a problem in Brazil, but the complete loss of the Amazon is a worst-case scenario. Climates are linked globally, so loss of the Amazon forests could certainly affect agriculture here in the U.S. as well. plants and trees release water into the atmosphere, which creates clouds and then rain. Bad agricultural practices like intense farming not only contribute to deforestation in the first instance but also affect the absorbency of the soil, meaning it dries out much quicker.<br>
			<h4><br>High water demand – </h4>There are several reasons water demand might outweigh the supply, including intensive agriculture and population spikes. Also, high demand upstream in rivers (for dams or irrigation) can cause drought in lower, downstream areas. ERL graphic iopscience_header.jpg

			Over the past 50 years, human water use has more than doubled and affected streamflow over various regions of the world. However, it remains unclear to what degree human water consumption intensifies hydrological drought (the occurrence of anomalously low streamflow). Here, we quantify over the period 1960–2010 the impact of human water consumption on the intensity and frequency of hydrological drought worldwide. The results show that human water consumption substantially reduced local and downstream streamflow over Europe, North America and Asia, and subsequently
			 intensified the magnitude of hydrological droughts by 10–500%, occurring during nation- and continent-wide drought events. Also, human water consumption alone increased global drought frequency by 27 (±6)%. The intensification of drought frequency is most severe over Asia (35 ± 7%), but also substantial over North America (25 ± 6%) and Europe (20 ± 5%). Importantly, the severe drought conditions are driven primarily by human water consumption over many parts of these regions. Irrigation is responsible for the intensification of hydrological droughts over the western and central US, southern Europe and Asia, whereas the impact of industrial and households' consumption on the intensification is considerably larger over the eastern US and western and central Europe.
			  Our findings reveal that human water consumption is one of the more important mechanisms intensifying hydrological drought, and is likely to remain as a major factor affecting drought intensity and frequency in the coming decades.</p>
		<h1 id="effect">Effects of Drought</h1>
		<p>The effects of drought can be devastating, including crop failures, water shortages, and increased risk of wildfires. It can also lead to social and economic impacts such as food insecurity, displacement, and loss of livelihoods.
			<h4><br>Economic Impacts </h4>
Economic impacts are those impacts of drought that cost people (or businesses) money. Here are just a few different examples of economic impacts: <br>

<br>&#x2022;Farmers may lose money if a drought destroys their crops.<br>
<br>&#x2022;If a farmer's water supply is too low, the farmer may have to spend more money on irrigation or to drill new wells.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Ranchers may have to spend more money on feed and water for their animals.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Businesses that depend on farming, like companies that make tractors and food, may lose business when drought damages crops or livestock.<br>
<br> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

  </div><br>
<br>&#x2022;People who work in the timber industry may be affected when wildfires destroy stands of timber.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Businesses that sell boats and fishing equipment may not be able to sell some of their goods because drought has dried up lakes and other water sources.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Power companies that normally rely on hydroelectric power (electricity that's created from the energy of running water) may have to spend more money on other fuel sources if drought dries up too much of the water supply. The power companies' customers would also have to pay more.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Water companies may have to spend money on new or additional water supplies.<br>
<br>&#x2022;Barges and ships may have difficulty navigating streams, rivers, and canals because of low water levels, which would also affect businesses that depend on water transportation for receiving or sending goods and materials.<br>
<br>&#x2022;People might have to pay more for food. <br>
<br><h4>Environmental Impacts</h4>
<br>Drought also affects the environment in many different ways. Plants and animals depend on water, just like people. When a drought occurs, their food supply can shrink and their habitat can be damaged. Sometimes the damage is only temporary and their habitat and food supply return to normal when the drought is over. But sometimes drought's impact on the environment can last a long time, maybe forever. Examples of environmental impacts include: <br>

<br>&#x2022;Losses or destruction of fish and wildlife habitat<br>
<br>&#x2022;Lack of food and drinking water for wild animals<br>
<br>&#x2022;Increase in disease in wild animals, because of reduced food and water supplies<br>
<br>&#x2022;Migration of wildlife<br>
<br>&#x2022;Increased stress on endangered species or even extinction<br>

<br>&#x2022;Lower water levels in reservoirs, lakes, and ponds<br>
<br>&#x2022;Loss of wetlands<br>
<br>&#x2022;More wildfires<br>
<br>&#x2022;Wind and water erosion of soils<br>
<br>&#x2022;Poor soil quality <br>
<br><h4>Social Impacts</h4>
<br>Social impacts of drought are ways that drought affects people’s health and safety. Social impacts include public safety, health, conflicts between people when there isn't enough water to go around, and changes in lifestyle. Examples of social impacts include:<br>

<br>&#x2022;Anxiety or depression about economic losses caused by drought<br>
<br>&#x2022;Health problems related to low water flows and poor water quality<br>
<br>&#x2022;Health problems related to dust<br>
<br>&#x2022;Loss of human life<br>
<br>&#x2022;Threat to public safety from an increased number of forest and range fires<br>
<br>&#x2022;Reduced incomes<br>
<br>&#x2022;People may have to move from farms into cities, or from one city to another<br>
<br>&#x2022;Fewer recreational activities<br>

		<h1 id="prev">Preventing Drought</h1>
		<p>Preventing drought involves both natural and human interventions. These include sustainable land use practices, efficient water management, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
			<br>We have seen examples of how droughts can create great economic instabilities, owing to the lessened production of resources. In the past 40 years, no natural disaster has affected more people than droughts.

			<br>Climate change has been a major factor in the creation of droughts in several parts of the world. As the earth is heating up, many regions of the world are experiencing less precipitation and droughts are becoming more common than ever before.

			<br>However, we humans have the ability to think and use our skills to engineer solutions, and in this article, we will go through some of these methods.<br>

 

			<br>1. Desalination of water<br><div style="text-align:center;">
				<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/water-desalination_resize_md.jpg" alt="Water Desalination">
			  </div>
			
			<br>Even though more than 70% of the earth’s surface is covered with water, only 0.003% of it is fresh water. In many places of the world, annual rainfall is the only way to replenish the freshwater sources. 

But what if we could desalinate water? Then we have oceans to help us get fresh water. 

But it is easier said than done. Desalination of water is pretty resource intensive. First, the water needs to be boiled, converted to steam and then condensed. 

This requires a significant amount of fossil fuels to produce heat. But hope is still at hand as the developments in the field has made filters made up of graphene that can desalinate water with nothing more than hydrostatic pressure.<br>

 

<br>2. Rainwater harvesting <br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/rainwater-harvesting_resize_md.png" alt="Rainwater harvesting ">
  </div>
<br>Rainwater harvesting has seen major growth in recent years and this is something everyone should adopt. With rainwater harvesting, homes can store the water they get from rain and then use it when they need it in dry conditions. 

In urban areas, only 15% of rainwater enters the ground while in rural areas 50% of rainwater is absorbed into the ground. Rainwater harvesting provides both urban and rural areas with an efficient option to store rainwater and then reuse it in times of drought. 

If a house has a primary water source, then rainwater harvesting provides them with an auxiliary option that they can use when water is not available. Rainwater harvesting is a great way to combat drought and is now encouraged among farmers and herders to provide their agriculture with water in times of drought.<br>

 

<br>3. Drip Irrigation<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/drip-irrigation_resize_md.jpeg" alt="Drip irrigation">
  </div>
<br>Drip irrigation hopes to achieve optimum water delivery for plants and optimum moisture in the soil. The advantage of such a system is that it does not result in water wastage.

Nowadays, many companies have come forward providing the market with cost-effective and intuitive drip irrigation systems. 

Technologically advanced farms are moving towards IoT inspired drip irrigation systems that can operate without human intervention. The highly targeted nature of drip irrigation ensures that each plant gets the right amount of water delivered right on its roots.<br>

 

<br>4. Harvesting water from the air<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/mit-water-from-air_resize_md.jpg" alt="Harvesting water from air">
  </div>
<br>Air as we know it contains many elements, and one among it is moisture. If we could build something efficient to harvest that moisture and condense it, we could harvest water from the air. 

And this is what researchers from MIT have done! 

This solar powered device uses a large surface area of the pores in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to catch water vapor and pass it between two temperatures zones to condense it. A field test conducted in Arizona was a success and now the team hopes to scale up the system so that it can produce many liters of water within a short period of time. 

The two major advantages of this system are that it can harvest water without the use of electricity and the ability to produce water in desert climates.<br>

 

<br>5. Crop engineering<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/wheat-crop_resize_md.jpg" alt="Wheat crop">
  </div>
<br>We can build new mechanisms outside of the plants to keep them watered and safe from drought, but we could also genetically engineer them to be resilient to conditions where the water content in the soil is very low. 

Food production is a crucial part of keeping the population alive. However, droughts can affect the productivity and tip the balance of food available to the masses. 

Crop engineering hopes to tweak the genetics of existing crops to help them increase their yield and provide them with better resistance to drought. 

A research project from Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE) has successfully improved corps in the way they use water, up to 25% more efficiently. 

Researches have been done by various organizations around the world in efforts to engineer crops that can withstand the harshness of droughts.<br>

 

<br>6. Solar pumps <br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/solar-pump_resize_md.jpg" alt="Rbr>Solar pumps">
  </div>
<br>The most common method that we use to water crops or provide water to livestock is by pumping it out of the earth. However, pumps do consume electricity, which in turn, consumes more fossil fuels. 

Solar pumps are gaining popularity because they do not use up electricity from the mains to pump water for irrigation. The governments around the world are realizing the potential of solar pumps and some have even started granting subsidies for farmers to install them cost-effectively.<br>

 

<br>7. Recycling organic waste<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<br>8. Planting more trees <br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="https://ripe.illinois.edu/sites/ripe.illinois.edu/files/inline-images/tree-plantation_resize_md.jpg" alt="Tree plantation">
  </div>
<br>This is might sound like old-age advice, but planting tree is the best way to reduce damage from drought, improve the quality of the environment and increase the success of precipitation. 

Many countries have started their efforts by turning arid lands into forested by planting trees and saplings.<br>

 

<br>Conclusion<br>
<br>Drought is one of the most damaging natural disasters that we have faced in recent years. By bringing innovative ideas and solutions, we can reduce the effects of droughts as well as put measures in place to prevent the occurrence of this natural disaster altogether.

		<h1 id="about">Cases of Drought in India</h1><br>
		<p><br>Only about 35% of total agricultural land in India is irrigated and two-thirds of cultivated land is entirely dependent on rainfall. As such, the agricultural production system in the country is more vulnerable to damage from extreme climatic events, which causes increased water stress leading to inadequate water supplies for irrigation. Already, rises in average temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as severe droughts and floods, and the shifting of agricultural seasons have been observed in different agro-ecological zones of India. Long drought spells during Kharif and increased temperatures and unseasonal heavy rains during the rabi season have caused serious distress to the farming communities in different states in recent years. Four major farming systems are prevailing in India: the irrigated system, rainfed system, silvo-pastoral system, and desert farming.<br>

			<br>In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines, including the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; and the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died.[3][4] The 2013 Maharashtra drought affected 25 million people.[citation needed] In simple words, drought has destroyed India on a large scale. Eighteen meteorological and 16 hydrological droughts occurred in India between 1870 and 2018. The most severe meteorological droughts were in the years 1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 2000,  while the five worst hydrological droughts occurred in the years 1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 2000. The drought of 1899 can be classified as meteorological as well as hydrological and was the most severe documented drought India has ever experienced to date.<br></p>
